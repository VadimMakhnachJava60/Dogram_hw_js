                data-detailed-text="Pug, breed of toy dog that probably originated in China and was introduced to England near the end of the 17th century by Dutch traders. The Pug has a short muzzle and a tightly curled tail. It is a squarely built muscular dog with a large head, prominent dark eyes, and small drooping ears. At maturity it stands 10 to 13 inches (25.5 to 33 cm) tall at the withers and weighs about 14 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg). Its coat is short and glossy; colour is given in the breed standard as black or as silver or apricot fawn with a black line on the back and a black mask on the face. Typically loyal and alert, the Pug is a valued companion dog.">dangerous

            data-detailed-text="Here I have to specify that ‘Black Dog’ as used throughout this article does not refer simply to domestic dogs that are black, but to a specific sort of frightening, monstrous creature that has the form of a very large, black, shaggy-coated dog, is mostly associated with rural roads, town edges and green places, and which is described as atypical relative to domestic dogs and, furthermore, able to generate an unusual amount of fear in those who encounter it. In discussing the Black Dog, we almost certainly aren’t talking about an actual animal or race of animals but instead some kind of folkloric or cultural entity, perhaps meaning that this article is out of place on a blog devoted to zoology. But read on.">
